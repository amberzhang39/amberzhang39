### Hello there! 👋

I'm Amber Zhang, a dedicated software engineer specializing in full-stack development and cloud technologies. Here's a glimpse of what I'm all about:

🌱 Currently, I possess advanced proficiency in Python, Django, AWS infrastructure, and React.js, constantly seeking ways to innovate and create seamless user experiences.

🔭 I'm currently immersed in the Smart Cooking Pot project, where I'm harnessing the power of AWS to store data in S3 and DynamoDB, all while exploring AI-driven image scanning for a touch of magic.

🤝 I'm always open to collaboration and eager to learn from fellow developers. If you share the same passion for tech, let's connect and cook up something incredible together!

📫 Let's connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amber-ying-zhang-irvine/) to explore the possibilities together! 

⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not busy coding, you can find me hitting the trails with my four-legged hiking buddy. 🐾🏞️
